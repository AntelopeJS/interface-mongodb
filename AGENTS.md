# interface-mongodb

The AntelopeJS interface that hands modules the project's shared `MongoClient`, published as `@antelopejs/interface-mongodb`. The whole contract lives in `src/index.ts`. The implementation, `@antelopejs/mongodb`, lives in its own repository.

## Contract

- `GetClient()` is the public API. The `internal` namespace (`client`, `connected`, `SetClient`, `UnsetClient`) is marked `@internal`, but `@antelopejs/mongodb` (`src/connection.ts`) writes to it to publish and reset the connection. Renaming or reshaping any of these members breaks that implementation.
- `@antelopejs/mongodb` depends on this package with a `>=0.0.6 <1.0.0` range, so a breaking change here also needs a new range there.

## Versioning

`mongodb` is a runtime dependency, not a peer dependency. The compatibility table in `README.md` mirrors `package.json#dependencies` (the `docs-compat` marker), and the CI docs check fails when they differ. When you change the `mongodb` range, update both, and keep it in step with the range `@antelopejs/mongodb` declares.

## Tests

- The package has no runtime tests. `pnpm test` only runs `pnpm run build` (clean `dist`, then `tsc`), so `pnpm run checks` proves the package builds.
- `pnpm run checks` does not run the documentation check. CI runs it through the `docs-files` input in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. To run it locally, clone `AntelopeJS/tooling-configs` at `v0.0.9` (the ref ci-node pins), run `npm ci --prefix actions/docs --omit=dev`, then run `node <clone>/actions/docs/check.mjs --files "$(printf 'README.md\ndocs')"` from this repository.

## Shipped files

`docs/` and `skills/` ship in the npm package. `docs/` holds the guide the package `homepage` (interfaces.antelopejs.com/docs/mongodb) points to. `skills/` reaches users through `antelopeJs.skills`; when the contract changes, update `skills/mongodb-interface/SKILL.md`.

## Guardrails

Finish every change with `pnpm run checks`. It runs typecheck, lint, format, knip, tests, size, ratchet, and sync, and prints only what failed. The change is done when it prints no failure.

The tools enforce most rules, listed in the table at the end. The sections below hold the rules no tool checks.

### Comments

Say it in code. A constraint belongs in a type, a lint rule, or a test. A public item's contract belongs in TSDoc (`/** */`) on that item. The only other comments are lint directives that name their rules, `@ts-expect-error <reason>`, `SAFETY: <reason>` above a type assertion, `/*!` license headers, and bundler or formatter directives.

### Tests

Hold every test you write or keep to this checklist:

- Name the wrong implementation this test fails on. A test with no answer is deleted, not kept.
- No test reads the file it tests. Drive the behaviour through the public interface.
- An invariant over many files is a lint rule, not a test.

### Debt

`guardrails.ratchet.json` records the lint findings and oversize files this repository already had. Its numbers only go down. After you remove debt, run `pnpm run ratchet:update` and commit the lowered file. A rule listed there is off for `oxlint`. The ratchet counts it instead, and the pre-commit hook rejects it on every line you add.

### What enforces what

| Rule                                                                           | Enforced by                               |
